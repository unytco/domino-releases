st Plan: Basic Features, UI/UX Feedback

3. Feedback

#### Why we are asking Partners to do testing: 

Our tools are all built with automated unit testing and reliability testing, and Holochain is continually expanding their performance testing, so we’re not so much seeking functional testing, but we are looking for feedback about:

*  UX and UI usability for what could be a complex or confusing process for end-users and/or project administrators. 
* Configurability to the needs and functions of your project. We have gone from a single-function currency, to one that must be able to function in a variety of ways. You need to make sure it functions in the ways you need it to, because we can’t predict all those variants.
* White Label / Branding dynamics: We expect projects to customize some of the appearance of the interfaces to match their branding, we need to make sure we’ve made that work for your project.
* Value Workflow: You need to make sure the complete value flows work for your customers and service providers. Do your customers have an appropriate way in? (They may already need to hold your token to buy internal units.) Do your service providers have a sensible way to prove the value they’re providing? Do they have a clear way to cash out of the internal units to your token? Are there any other value transfers needed, if so, can those be completed reasonably easily?
* Administrative Workflow: Do your technical people understand how to update your configuration? Can they do so successfully? What high level reports do you need to be able to see?

Phase 1: Basic Features & UI/UX Feedback

Starting: January 29, 2025

Duration: 2 -3 weeks

Test usability of the full range of basic transactional functionality

* set up new user / accounts (3?)
* send/receive via normal transactions, including credit limit enforcement and deduction of transaction fees
