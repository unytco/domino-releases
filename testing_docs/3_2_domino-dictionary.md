**Agent**
: A participant's identifier in a Domino Alliance, represented by a public/private key pair, used for all interactions and transactions.

**Agreement Code Template (Template)**
: Defines core reusable logic for Smart Agreements, including input/output schemas and execution code.

**Code Sheet (Data Record)**
: A flexible Data Record for custom logic, price sheets, or other publishable data referenced by participants.

**Compute Transaction Fee Agreement**
: A System Agreement within the Global Configuration that determines how Transaction Fees are calculated and their payment threshold.

**Conversion Table (Data Record)**
: A Data Record defining a fixed price by equating a number of Service Units to 1 Fuel Credit.

**Credit Limit**
: The amount below zero an Agent can spend in Fuel Credits, determined by the System Credit Limit Computation agreement in their Domino Alliance.

**Data Records**
: Stored content (e.g., Conversion Table, Recipe, Code Sheet) referenced by Smart Agreements, often for service pricing.

**DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)**
: Networks Domino primarily supports, focusing on high-volume, low-cost transactions for real-world services.

**DMNO (Decentralized Microtransaction Network Orchestration)**
: An acronym that the name Domino is derived from, representing its function in orchestrating decentralized microtransactions amongst members of a peer-to-peer network.

**Domino**
: Decentralized software for microtransaction accounting, enabling communities to run their own peer-to-peer Domino Accounting Alliances.

**Domino Accounting Alliance (Domino Alliance)**

: An Agent authorized to perform the execution of a Smart Agreement, transforming its inputs into outputs according to its defined rules.

**Fee Percentage**
: The percentage rate charged as a Transaction Fee on Spend transactions, defined in the Global Configuration.

**Ledger Details**
: A modal in the interface showing an Agent's Fuel Credits Balance, Fees Owed, Unclaimed credits, and Credit Limit.

**Library (Templates and Agreements Library)**
: A central repository within Domino where participants in that Domino Alliance can create, find, and interact with Agreement Code Templates and Smart Agreements.

**Parked (Transaction Type)**

: The action taken by a Spender to send Fuel Credits, sometimes of thier own initiative, sometimes in response to an Invoice, and other times as a way of interacting with a Smart Agreement.

**Proof of Service Agreement (Service Network)**
: A Smart Agreement used within a Service Network for Service Providers to prove that services have been rendered and for Payors to Park Spends as payment for such services.

**Purchase Agreement (Service Network)**
: A Smart Agreement governing the purchase of Fuel Credits from a particular Service Network within that Domino Alliance, with payment in that Service Network's Outside Currency.

**Recipe (Data Record)**

**Receiver**
: An Agent designated to receive Fuel Credits or Service Units in a transaction or as an outcome of a Smart Agreement.

**Redemption Agreement (Service Network)**
: A Smart Agreement governing the redemption of Fuel Credits by a Service Network's Service Providers, redeeming into that Service Network's Outside Currency. 

**Redemption Fee**
: Not explicitly defined as a standard system-wide fee. Any such fees are to be defined by a Service Network's custom Redemption Agreement logic or pricing structure.

**Role (in Smart Agreement)**
: Defines a class of Agents (e.g., "Vendor," "Customer") and grants specific authorizations for interacting with a Smart Agreement.

**Sales Agent (in Service Network)**

**SAVED (Smart Agreement Verifiably Executed & Documented) / previously RAVE (Record of Agreement Verifiably Executed)(VET - Verifiably Executed Transformation)**
: The immutable documentation resulting from the valid execution of a Smart Agreement by an Executor, published for verification.

**Service Fee**
: A charge that can be levied for services rendered or transactions processed. Can be defined within Smart Agreements.

**Service Network**
: An organization within a Domino Alliance, set up by that Alliances Global Admin, that defines its own configuration, services, and typically uses specific Smart Agreements for its operations. 

**Service Network Console** {TODO: change UI to match. Currently Update Service-Network Properties}
