## Setup
Note: The release for your operating system may not be code signed yet, so you may need to right click to open the file.

When you open HFvZ on your operating system for the first time, it will create a set of public and private keys for you that you can use to interact with others. These are stored in a private keystore (Lair) on your own machine and are used during future uses. 

To get started, you will want to install the software on a couple of devices so you can try sending, executing, and receiving transactions. 

Next, dive into the [Test Plan](./testing_docs/1_0_testing_plan.md).
